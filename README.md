# About
Diablo II Resurrected calculator is my FIRST project written in vanilla Javascript. This project took me most time among all of my projects and also it have the best potential of all projects i created.
# My vision
I wanted to put huge part of the game inside the website so if someone want to check something he could use this website with faster results instead of desktop app or the game itself.
# Features
When user set desired level of the character, he receives points to invest in skills (like in diablo 2) with logic that will check if the user match requirements for investing points in given skill.
User can hold control key and use LMB to add 10 points at a time or use RMB and delete 10 points at atime from skill.

More information on the page.
# Problems
Diablo 2 Reurrected currently don't have API with skill damage for each level of that skill etc. so as one person I can't make this website to work as intended.
